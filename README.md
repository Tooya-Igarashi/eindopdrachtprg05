<h1>Laravel progression</h1>
<br>
<p>15-10-2025</p>
<p>Pages voor index en details werken, alleen nog correct stijlen</p>

<p>16-10-2025</p>
<p>Page voor detail aangemaakt en 1 op veel relatie gemaakt met genres</p>

<p>17-10-2025</p>
<p>Added styling to the pages and made errors and requirement field to create page, 
made sure the create page works properly now and actually gives the filled in information to the database</p>

<p>20-10-2025</p>
<p> Tried doing the update and delete functions by myself by having the prg02 assignment with me to retrace steps.
This went very wrong, I went to follow another Laracast video about update and delete and with some small differences like
using my controller instead of making everything in route I got it to work</p>

<p>21-10-2025</p>
<p>Made very basic authentication for the edit page, still need to edit the log out route and stuff
but will do that later today, commiting since I might screw stuff up with it</p>

<p>24-10-2025</p>
<p>Made the admin page and there with it a way to authenticate posts, so the admin first has to authenticate post
before they can be seen, should I change the default validation_check value then? A question for later.
Need to update the dashboard to go to the admin page instead of the dashboard laravel made</p>

<p>25-10-2025</p>
<p>I got the search and filter functions to work, I watched multiple tutorial videos online for it and got reminded 
of the form get function, which made me sort of understand how the chess website works with filters since the url changes.
Got it to work in the end</p>

<p>26-10-2025</p>
<p>Created comments, and with it dubbel varification, user now has to make at least 3 comments before they are allowed
to create a new post</p>

<p>27-10-2025</p>
<p>Made safe delete so only admin can see it, made some visual changes in navigation.
Just want to try to be able to add images and I think I an done</p>

<p>28-10-2025</p>
<p>Made it so users can upload images by adding a photos map in storage/public and linking this
with the public folder with the command php artisan storage:link. Also made some new dummy data
all with images</p>
