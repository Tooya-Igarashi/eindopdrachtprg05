<h1>Laravel progression</h1>

<p>15-10-2025</p>
<p>Pages voor index en details werken, alleen nog correct stijlen</p>

<p>16-10-2025</p>
<p>Page voor detail aangemaakt en 1 op veel relatie gemaakt met genres</p>

<p>17-10-2025</p>
<p>Added styling to the pages and made errors and requirement field to create page, 
made sure the create page works properly now and actually gives the filled in information to the database</p>

<p> Tried doing the update and delete functions by myself by having the prg02 assignment with me to retrace steps.
This went very wrong, I went to follow another Laracast video about update and delete and with some small differences like
using my controller instead of making everything in route I got it to work</p>
